Project Management Tool: Web-Based Task Management System

The Project Management Tool is a sophisticated web-based platform designed to streamline task management for individuals and teams. This comprehensive system offers a range of features that facilitate efficient task assignment, monitoring, and communication among users. Whether used by individuals or groups, this tool aims to enhance productivity and collaboration by providing essential functionalities.

Key Features:

1. Task Assignment: Users can create tasks, assign them to team members, and set deadlines. This feature ensures clear accountability and visibility of tasks within the project. Tasks can be categorized and prioritized for better organization.

2. Task Deletion: Users have the ability to delete tasks that are no longer relevant or necessary. This maintains a clutter-free task list and ensures that users focus on active and relevant tasks.

3. Task Timer: To improve time management, users can set timers for tasks. This feature helps users allocate specific time blocks to tasks, enhancing focus and productivity. Timers can be utilized as a Pomodoro technique or for other time management strategies.

4. User Management: The system allows administrators to add new users and remove existing ones. This is particularly useful in team settings where team members may change over time. User roles and permissions can also be managed to ensure appropriate access levels.

5. Chatbox Functionality: The integrated chatbox enables seamless communication among users. Individuals and teams can discuss tasks, share updates, and exchange information in real-time. This fosters collaboration and reduces the need for external communication tools.
